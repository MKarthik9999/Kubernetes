# Kubernetes
# What is a Pod?
A Pod is the smallest in Kubernetes, in Kubernetes we canâ€™t directly deploy a container instead we create a pod and deploy a container in that pod. A pod can have one or more containers. In docker we create containers, and those containers are managed individually but when we create a pod in Kubernetes the containers created in those pods can be managed all at once and these containers are deployed in a shared environment so they can communicate with each other. Pods are typically created and managed using a higher-level abstraction such as _**Deployments, Replicasets, or statefulsets which provide additional features like scaling, Roling updates, and self-healing capabilities**_. Since we know that a pod can contain one or more containers, because the main container might be running our main application, and other containers are used to support our main application container. _**The other containers are called sidecar containers or helper containers**_.
